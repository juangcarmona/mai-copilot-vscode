## **About the Project**

**MAI Copilot** aims to be a lightweight and efficient VSCode extension to assist developers with contextual AI-driven features, such as:

- Real-time code completion.
- Context-aware AI chat.
- Commit message generation based on pending changes.

The primary goal is to leverage project and file-level information directly from your workspace to enhance the quality of AI prompts and outputs. This includes insights like:

- Current file and cursor position.
- Recently modified files.
- Project structure and relevant metadata.

**Your AI, your rules.** Build your workflow around what works best for you.

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

- Visual Studio Code version 1.82.0 or higher.
- Node.js version 16 or higher.

## **Core Features**

1. **Contextual AI Suggestions**
   - Understand the project context (open files, recent edits, etc.) to generate tailored code suggestions.

2. **Chat with Context** *(Planned)*
   - Have AI-powered discussions directly in VSCode, using workspace and project data for better responses.

3. **Commit Message Generator** *(Planned)*
   - Generate meaningful commit messages by analyzing changes in your project.

4. **Logs and Insights** *(In Progress)*
   - Use a `.mai` folder in the workspace to store:
     - Recent file activity.
     - Project metadata.
     - Temporary logs for AI request optimization.

---

## **File System Design**

The extension uses a `.mai` folder in the workspace to maintain:

- **Logs**: Stored in `.mai/logs/events.log` to track file events and workspace activities.
- **Settings**: Default configuration saved in `.mai/settings.json`.
- **Metadata**: Includes project structure and recent activity insights.

This design ensures better context handling and user control without cluttering the main workspace.

## **Roadmap**

- [ ] **Basic Functionality**: Code completion and contextual suggestions.
- [ ] **Workspace Insights**: Better parsing of project structure and activity logs.
- [ ] **Chat Integration**: Enable AI chat features within VSCode.
- [ ] **Extended Customization**: Allow users to define prompt templates and AI behavior.
- [ ] **Hugging Face API Support** *(Potential Feature)*: Integrate with Hugging Face models for advanced users.
